  <h1>A Gallery</h1>
  <p>A collection of images that I took from a trip</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Philippines</h2>
  <img src="bruno mars.jpg" alt="bruno mars" title="Bruno Mars Live at the Philippine Arena in Bulacan, Philippines">
  <p>Bruno was dancing, showing off to the crowd in his iconic way. Hitting poses and stealing hearts, it was an unforgettable night.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="taal.jpg" alt="taal volcano" title="A view of Taal Volcano from afar.">
  <p>Fun fact, Taal is the smallest active volcano in the world. It actually erupted recently, just a little over a year ago.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="cabin.jpg" alt="cabin" title="A nice little spot from inside a cabin I was staying at.">
  <p>It was simple, calm, and fun. I definitely would go again but probably won't be able to for a very long time.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="tagaytay at night.jpg" alt="night view of Tagaytay" title="The view of the city from a hotel that I was staying at.">
  <p>It was probably one of the fanciest hotels I've been to, besides the fact that they only had one employee working the restaurant at night so it took an hour to get our food.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="sleep cat.jpg" alt="a sleeping cat" title="A cat asleep next to a window at one of the malls">
  <p>I remember telling everyone that I was with "Guys, look at the sleping cat, it's so cute!"</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="highlands.jpg" alt="view of Tagaytay Highlands" title="A view of Tagaytay Highlands from my cabin">
  <p>Me and my sister went out onto the deck and thought "Woah we should take some pictures" and this was the result</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="art in island.jpg" alt="flying turtles" title="Flying turtles inside of Art in Island in Quezon City">
  <p>My cousin took this on my phone but I thought it was too cool to leave out, so I decided to keep it in here.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="las casas residential.jpg" alt="houses" title="A beautiful garden surrounded by preserved houses at Las Casas in Bataan">
  <p>There's a restaurant just outside the frame of the photo that we were going to eat at and I saw this garden/path and thought it was pretty.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="las casas road.jpg" alt="road" title="A look down the road of Las Casas at night">
  <p>This place was so beautiful, you could take a picture of anything and it would've turned out pretty.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="bread.jpg" alt="bread" title="The bread station in The Spiral at Sofitel Hotel">
  <p>This buffet is considered to be the fanciest buffet in the Philippines, and I agree with it. There were so many options from so many different cultures, I was absolutely stuffed afterwards.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Japan</h2>
  <img src="bamboo forest.jpg" alt="bamboo forest" title="A picture inside of a bamboo forest at the Tenryu-ji Temple in Japan">
  <p>This was closer to the end of our tour before we went shopping, there were lots of buff guys pulling people around in carts.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="pond thing.jpg" alt="pond with greenery" title="I don't know what they're called, but they look like tall lilipads on top of water">
