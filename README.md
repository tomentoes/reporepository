  <p>A collection of images that I took and like</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="bruno mars.jpg" alt="bruno mars" title="Bruno Mars Live at the Philippine Arena in Bulacan, Philippines">
  <p>Bruno was dancing, showing off to the crowd in his iconic way. Hitting poses and stealing hearts, it was an unforgettable night.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="taal.jpg" alt="taal volcano" title="A view of Taal Volcano from afar.">
  <p>Fun fact, Taal is the smallest active volcano in the world. It actually erupted recently, just a little over a year ago.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="cabin.jpg" alt="cabin" title="A nice little spot from inside a cabin I was staying at.">
  <p>It was simple, calm, and fun. I definitely would go again but probably won't be able to for a very long time.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="tagaytay at night.jpg" alt="night view of Tagaytay" title="The view of the city from a hotel that I was staying at.">
  <p>It was probably one of the fanciest hotels I've been to, besides the fact that they only had one employee working the restaurant at night so it took an hour to get our food.</p>
